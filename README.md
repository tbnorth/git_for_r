# Git for R

This repository houses a presentation.

Everything's in the gh-pages branch, go there to see the source.

Or view the presentation online.

NOTE: the presentation uses [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/),
the HTML slide show framework.  The unchanged parts of reveal.js are
brought in in a single commit.
